Notre plateforme permet à n’importe quelle organisation de créer un système de transport en commun à la demande en utilisant ses propres véhicules. Contrairement au transport en commun traditionnel (c’est-à-dire à itinéraires et horaires fixes), le transport en commun à la demande permet de continuellement réarranger les itinéraires et les horaires des véhicules en fonction de la demande des passagers. Les sociétés de transport faisant appel à notre plateforme peuvent ainsi utiliser leurs véhicules plus efficacement (réduisant ainsi leurs émissions de gaz à effet de serre), offrir une meilleure expérience aux passagers et relier des communautés qui n'ont jamais eu accès à des services de transport en commun auparavant!\n\nLes valeurs fondamentales de Blaise sont les suivantes :\n• Nous sommes durables.

Our recent Collateral Damage publication series has addressed the implications for managers of the on-going financial crisis.\n\nWe believe that no other consulting organization has concentrated as thoroughly on understanding business competition and helping companies make the changes necessary to succeed in increasingly competitive markets.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNous recherchons des personnes ambitieuses, énergiques, avec de la capacité intellectuelle à mener au bout des projets et à persuader.

Plusieurs des principaux concepts d'affaires, au cours des trois dernières décennies, ont commencé avec BCG, y compris la courbe d'apprentissage, la concurrence calculée sur le temps, le marketing Segment-of-One®, le démantèlement et l'extension ascendante. Nos récentes publications de la série Collateral Damage ont traité de l'implication des dirigeants face à la crise financière en cours.\n\nNous croyons qu'aucune autre organisation de conseil en gestion ne s'est concentrée aussi attentivement à la compréhension de la concurrence en affaires et à aider les entreprises à effectuer les changements nécessaires pour réussir sur des marchés de plus en plus compétitifs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n• #L\n\nBoston Consulting Group is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Our platform allows any organization to create an on-demand transit system using their own vehicles. Unlike traditional (fixed-route) public transit, on-demand transit allows vehicles to be dynamically routed based on passenger demand. Using Blaise, our partner transit agencies can use their vehicles more efficiently (meaning less greenhouse gas emissions), provide a better passenger experience, and connect populations who have never had access to public transit before!\n\nWe hold the following values:\n• We are sustainable. We leave our clients, our team, and our world better than we found them.\n• We are innovative. We experiment with new solutions to help us continually improve.\n• We are empathetic. We listen to understand, so we can forge strong relationships.\n• We are inclusive. We want to be accessible to everyone, so we seek diverse perspectives.\n\nThings we hope our Frontend Developer Intern will do:\n• Implement new features and bug fixes in our mobile and web apps\n• Create technical designs for new features, and present them to the team\n• Provide feedback on technical designs presented by other developers\n• Provide feedback on feature specifications (e.g. user interface mockups and prototypes) created by other members of the Blaise team\n• Review code written by other members of our development team\n\nOur Frontend Developer Intern might have:\n• Knowledge of frontend development using React.js or React Native\n• One or more previous professional experiences (internships) using JavaScript\n• A portfolio of projects you worked on by yourself, or in a small team\n• Proficiency with Git and ticket management software such as Asana\n• BONUS: You’re passionate about code, public transit and urbanism\n\nPerks of joining us:\n• Learn how to write production quality code from our team of developers\n• Gain experience working as part of a real software development team\n• Get feedback and support from a mentor throughout your internship\n• Develop your own designs, get feedback, implement them, and see them deployed to production!\n• Participate in our Programming Book Club, and pick up best practices, design patterns, and programming concepts that you may not be exposed to during your day-to-day work.\n• Work with awesome, driven people!\n\nThe Blaise Transit team values diversity in all forms and is an equal opportunity employer. Creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable is a top priority. To that end, we welcome and encourage applications from those who self-identify as Indigenous, Black, as a Person of Colour, LGBTQ2S+, as a person with a disability, and/or any other minority.\n\nReady to join one of the fastest-growing, ambitious, impact-driven, and fully remote companies in Montreal?\n\nBlaise Transit a pour mission de créer des solutions de transport durables, agréables et accessibles à tous! Notre plateforme permet à n’importe quelle organisation de créer un système de transport en commun à la demande en utilisant ses propres véhicules. Contrairement au transport en commun traditionnel (c’est-à-dire à itinéraires et horaires fixes), le transport en commun à la demande permet de continuellement réarranger les itinéraires et les horaires des véhicules en fonction de la demande des passagers. Les sociétés de transport faisant appel à notre plateforme peuvent ainsi utiliser leurs véhicules plus efficacement (réduisant ainsi leurs émissions de gaz à effet de serre), offrir une meilleure expérience aux passagers et relier des communautés qui n'ont jamais eu accès à des services de transport en commun auparavant!\n\nLes valeurs fondamentales de Blaise sont les suivantes :\n• Nous sommes durables. Nous laissons nos clients, notre équipe et notre monde en meilleur état que nous les avons trouvés.\n• Nous sommes innovants. Nous expérimentons continuellement de nouvelles solutions afin de nous améliorer.\n• Nous sommes empathiques. Nous écoutons pour comprendre et ainsi développer des relations solides.\n• Nous sommes inclusifs. Nous voulons être accessibles à tous et nous recherchons donc des perspectives diverses.\n\nNous espérons que notre Stagiaire en Développement Frontend pourra assumer les fonctions suivantes:\n• Implémenter de nouvelles fonctionnalités et corriger les bogues dans nos applications mobiles et web\n• Contribuer à la conception technologique des nouvelles fonctionnalités et la présenter au reste de l’équipe\n• Fournir de la rétroaction sur les plans techniques présentés par les autres développeurs\n• Fournir de la rétroaction sur les spécifications des fonctionnalités (par exemple des maquettes et prototypes d’interface utilisateur) créées par les autres membres de l’équipe Blaise\n• Réviser le code écrit par les autres développeurs\n\nNotre Stagiaire en Développement Frontend aurait idéalement :\n• Une bonne connaissance du développement frontend avec les outils React.js ou React Native\n• Une ou plusieurs expériences professionnelles antérieures (stages) impliquant JavaScript\n• Un portfolio de projets sur lesquels vous avez travaillé seul ou avec une petite équipe\n• Une maîtrise de Git et d’un logiciel de gestion de tickets (par exemple Asana)\n• BONUS: Une passion pour le transport en commun et l’urbanisme\n\nLes avantages de se joindre à nous :\n• Apprendre à écrire du code de production de haute qualité grâce à notre équipe de développeurs\n• Acquérir une expérience de travail professionnelle au sein d'une véritable équipe de développement logiciel\n• Bénéficier de la rétroaction et du soutien d'un mentor pendant votre stage\n• Développer vos propres conceptions, recevoir des conseils sur ceux-ci, les mettre en œuvre et les voir déployées en production!\n• Participer à notre club de lecture sur la programmation et développer des meilleures pratiques, des modèles de conception et des concepts de programmation auxquels vous n'êtes peut-être pas exposé dans votre travail quotidien.\n• Travailler avec des personnes sympathiques et motivées !\n\nL'équipe de Blaise Transit valorise la diversité sous toutes ses formes et s’engage à garantir l’égalité des chances à toutes les personnes candidates qualifiées. La création d'un environnement inclusif où chacun se sent à l'aise est une priorité absolue. À cette fin, nous accueillons et encourageons les candidatures de tout individu s'identifiant comme autochtone, noir, personne de couleur, LGBTQ2S+, personne handicapée et/ou faisant partie de toute autre minorité.\n\nÊtes-vous prêt à rejoindre une entreprise complètement en télétravail qui est en pleine croissance et parmi les plus ambitieuses et les plus dynamiques de Montréal?",
