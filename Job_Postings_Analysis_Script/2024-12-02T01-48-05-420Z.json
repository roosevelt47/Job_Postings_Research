Our platform allows any organization to create an on-demand transit system using their own vehicles. Unlike traditional (fixed-route) public transit, on-demand transit allows vehicles to be dynamically routed based on passenger demand. Using Blaise, our partner transit agencies can use their vehicles more efficiently (meaning less greenhouse gas emissions), provide a better passenger experience, and connect populations who have never had access to public transit before!\n\nWe hold the following values:\n• We are sustainable. We leave our clients, our team, and our world better than we found them.\n• We are innovative. We experiment with new solutions to help us continually improve.\n• We are empathetic. We listen to understand, so we can forge strong relationships.\n• We are inclusive. We want to be accessible to everyone, so we seek diverse perspectives.\n\nThings we hope our Frontend Developer Intern will do:\n• Implement new features and bug fixes in our mobile and web apps\n• Create technical designs for new features, and present them to the team\n• Provide feedback on technical designs presented by other developers\n• Provide feedback on feature specifications (e.g. user interface mockups and prototypes) created by other members of the Blaise team\n• Review code written by other members of our development team\n\nOur Frontend Developer Intern might have:\n• Knowledge of frontend development using React.js or React Native\n• One or more previous professional experiences (internships) using JavaScript\n• A portfolio of projects you worked on by yourself, or in a small team\n• Proficiency with Git and ticket management software such as Asana\n• BONUS: You’re passionate about code, public transit and urbanism\n\nPerks of joining us:\n• Learn how to write production quality code from our team of developers\n• Gain experience working as part of a real software development team\n• Get feedback and support from a mentor throughout your internship\n• Develop your own designs, get feedback, implement them, and see them deployed to production!\n• Participate in our Programming Book Club, and pick up best practices, design patterns, and programming concepts that you may not be exposed to during your day-to-day work.\n• Work with awesome, driven people!\n\nThe Blaise Transit team values diversity in all forms and is an equal opportunity employer. Creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable is a top priority. To that end, we welcome and encourage applications from those who self-identify as Indigenous, Black, as a Person of Colour, LGBTQ2S+, as a person with a disability, and/or any other minority.\n\nReady to join one of the fastest-growing, ambitious, impact-driven, and fully remote companies in Montreal?\n\nBlaise Transit a pour mission de créer des solutions de transport durables, agréables et accessibles à tous! Notre plateforme permet à n’importe quelle organisation de créer un système de transport en commun à la demande en utilisant ses propres véhicules. Contrairement au transport en commun traditionnel (c’est-à-dire à itinéraires et horaires fixes), le transport en commun à la demande permet de continuellement réarranger les itinéraires et les horaires des véhicules en fonction de la demande des passagers. Les sociétés de transport faisant appel à notre plateforme peuvent ainsi utiliser leurs véhicules plus efficacement (réduisant ainsi leurs émissions de gaz à effet de serre), offrir une meilleure expérience aux passagers et relier des communautés qui n'ont jamais eu accès à des services de transport en commun auparavant!\n\nLes valeurs fondamentales de Blaise sont les suivantes :\n• Nous sommes durables. Nous laissons nos clients, notre équipe et notre monde en meilleur état que nous les avons trouvés.\n• Nous sommes innovants.
